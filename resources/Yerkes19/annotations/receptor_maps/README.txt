1. Volumes reconstructed with nl_flow (i.e., missing receptor densities linearly interpolated through deformation field between adjacent sections)
2. Volumes reconstructed in MEBRAINS space and the volumetrically aligned to Yerkes
3. Averaged volumes were created for all 3 left hemisphere volumes (right hemisphere excluded) and the occipital lobe of 11539-L was droppedbecause it was poorly reconstructed.
4. Volumes projected onto Yerkes 32k surface with nearest neighbour interpolation
